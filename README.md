# Sb3 to TurboWarp

Given a folder like `projects/`, creates an index.html page with links to scratch .sb3 projects hosted on a server other than officai scratch site. 

Links will open in [turbowarp.org](https://turbowarp.org) scratch fork, which can open projects from URL and has a much more efficient compiler.'

For convenience all needed js and css files will be packaged in a single `index.html` file.
