# Sb3 to TurboWarp

Given a folder like `projects/`, creates an index.html page with links to scratch .sb3 projects hosted on a custom server other than official scratch site. 

Links will open in [turbowarp.org](https://turbowarp.org) scratch fork, which was chosen as it can open projects from URL (bonus: has also a much more efficient vm).

All needed js and css files are packaged in a single `index.html` file for deployment convenience.
